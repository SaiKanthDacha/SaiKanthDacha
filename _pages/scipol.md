<!-- I am strongly motivated about public policy in the science and technology (S&T) domain. -->

My interest in S&T policy dates back to the Spring of 2021, when I attended an S&T policy class that was taught by Prof. Rosina Bierbaum and Prof. Jim Gates, both members of [President Obama's PCAST](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/administration/eop/ostp/pcast). There, I had the opportunity to interact and discuss U.S. S&T policy with renowned experts in the field, including Dr. John Holdren, President Obama's [OSTP Director](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/administration/eop/ostp/about/leadershipstaff/director).

From then on, I have taken part in a number of S&T policy activities, including policy workshops, case competitions and grassroots-level advocacy groups. I enjoy communicating science to policy-makers and helping them frame effective policy that helps strengthen investments in science, education and STEM workforce. I also enjoy writing about science, and I strongly believe that consistent and healthy government funding of academic research in all fundamental and applied sciences is essential for creating new technologies that are capable of solving the greatest of our collective challenges.

If you are interested, here is a brief list of my recent adventures in the world of S&T policy:

* In the Spring of 2023, through the National Photonics Initiative, I visited the United States Capitol to meet with the offices of U.S. Representatives and Senators. I discussed with them the critical importance of Federal policy support for photonics R&D. I also had the chance to voice my support for immigration policy reform for international STEM students and workers.

* For nearly two years until my graduation in Summer 2022, I was a member of a DEI committee at UMD's Institute for Research in Electronics and Applied Physics (IREAP), advocating for addressing systemic racism within STEM institutes such as UMD and IREAP. Read more about the committee and our activities [here](https://ireap.umd.edu/ireap-role).

* In the Summer of 2021, through the National Photonics Initiative, I had the honor of communicating the research that I do at UMD and advocating for increased Federal funding for optics and photonics R&D to numerous members of the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives.

* In the Spring of 2021, I was part of UMD's first team to participate in the prestigious Emory Global Health Case Competition. See the blog article that I wrote on my experience [here](https://skdacha.com/posts/2021/03/reflection-emory-case-competition/).

* During the Spring of 2021, I underwent the annual training by the [Climate Reality Project](https://www.climaterealityproject.org/training)'s to join their U.S. Leadership Corps.
