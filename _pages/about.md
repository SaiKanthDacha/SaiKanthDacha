Hi! My name is Sai Kanth, I am a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at the [Quantum and Nonlinear Photonics Group](https://gaeta.apam.columbia.edu) at Columbia University. In July 2022, I defended my Ph.D. thesis in Physics at the University of Maryland. I was previously (May-Dec 2021) a Research Intern at Nokia Bell Labs. In 2016, I received my Bachelor of Technology degree in Engineering Physics at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras.

My research interests lie in the broad area of photonics. Nonlinear optics, classical and quantum optical communication, orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light and multimode fibers are of specific interest to me. The intersection of fundamental optical science and modern day practical and scientific applications is one that I find fascinating.

## Current Research

At Columbia, I am a postdoc at [Prof. Alexander Gaeta](https://gaeta.apam.columbia.edu)'s research group. My current research interests lie in the realm of microresonators, optical frequency combs and integrated photonics. Previously, at the University of Maryland's [Institute for Research in Electronics and Applied Physics (IREAP)](https://ireap.umd.edu), I worked with [Prof. Thomas E. Murphy](https://ece.umd.edu/clark/faculty/443/Thomas-E-Murphy) on experimental investigation of nonlinear optical effects in multimode fibers. At [Bell Labs](https://www.bell-labs.com/#gref), I worked with [Dr. René-Jean Essiambre](http://www.bell-labs.com/about/researcher-profiles/reneessiambre/) on experimental quantum optical communication. Please see my [Research](https://skdacha.com/research/) page for further information.


## Other Interests

I am an avid photographer and biker. I enjoy spending my free time playing the piano, reading, writing, cooking, painting, and playing chess. I enjoy learning deeply about anything that sufficiently capture my curiosity, be it the nitty gritty of commercial aviation, Roman history and its implications for the modern West, human psychology and mental health, urbanism, or the simple yet deeply complex game of chess. Stumbling upon deep connections between things that might initially seem unrelated is a feeling that I relish.

<!-- I consider myself a "[philomath](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/philomath)" in that I enjoy letting myself get lost in learning things that are new to me, be it the nitty gritty of modern commercial aviation, the fascinating world of ancient Roman history, the complicated field of psychology and mental health, or the all-important modern financial system. One of my favorite things is to explore and delve deep into topics that interest me, and finding that things that might initially seem unrelated in fact share deep connections and parallels. -->

This "cross-disciplinary" (for the lack of a better term) view of the world extends into how I think about scientific research. I am a big advocate of the idea of the [edge effect](https://www.npr.org/2018/07/02/625426015/the-edge-effect), and I strongly believe that the best and most creative science is done when scientists from a diverse set of backgrounds working in vastly different topics talk and interact with one another.
