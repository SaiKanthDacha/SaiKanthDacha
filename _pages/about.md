Hi! My name is Sai Kanth, I am a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at the [Quantum and Nonlinear Photonics Group](https://gaeta.apam.columbia.edu) at Columbia University. In July 2022, I defended my Ph.D. thesis in Physics at the University of Maryland. I was previously (May-Dec 2021) a Research Intern at Nokia Bell Labs. In 2016, I received my Bachelor of Technology degree in Engineering Physics at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras.

My research interests lie in the broad area of photonics. Nonlinear optics, classical and quantum optical communication, orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light and multimode fibers are of specific interest to me. The intersection of fundamental optical science and modern day practical and scientific applications is one that I find fascinating.

## Current Research

At the University of Maryland's [Institute for Research in Electronics and Applied Physics (IREAP)](https://ireap.umd.edu), I worked with [Prof. Thomas E. Murphy](https://ece.umd.edu/clark/faculty/443/Thomas-E-Murphy) on experimental investigation of nonlinear optical effects in multimode fibers. At [Bell Labs](https://www.bell-labs.com/#gref), I worked with [Dr. René-Jean Essiambre](http://www.bell-labs.com/about/researcher-profiles/reneessiambre/) on experimental quantum optical communication. Please see my [Research](https://skdacha.com/research/) page for further information.

<!--I work with Prof. Thomas E. Murphy as part of the [Photonics Research Laboratory](https://photonics.umd.edu) at the University of Maryland. My current work is on experimental investigation of nonlinear optical effects in multimode fibers. Despite having been around since before the advent of the single mode fiber, nonlinear optics in multimode fibers remains relatively understudied. Over the past few years, there has been a revival of interest in understanding nonlinear optics in these systems. As few-mode fibers and multimode fibers become more prevalent in longer-distance networks, and with the advent of techniques for spatially-multiplexed optical amplification, nonlinear effects in these fibers are expected to play an increasingly important role. As part of my work with Prof. Murphy, I develop high-resolution spatiotemporal characterization tools to better understand the physics governing intermodal nonlinear effects. More on my current and previous research [here](https://skdacha.com/research/).-->

## Other Interests

I am an avid photographer and biker. I enjoy spending my free time reading, writing, cooking, painting, and playing Chess.

I consider myself a "[philomath](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/philomath)" in that I enjoy letting myself get lost in learning things that are new to me, be it the nitty gritty of modern commercial aviation, the fascinating world of ancient Roman history, the complicated field of psychology and mental health, or the all-important modern financial system. One of my favorite things is to explore and delve deep into topics that interest me, and finding that things that might initially seem unrelated in fact share deep connections and parallels.

This "cross-disciplinary" (for the lack of a better term) view of the world extends into how I think about scientific research. I am a big believer and advocate in the idea of the [edge effect](https://www.npr.org/2018/07/02/625426015/the-edge-effect), and I strongly believe that the best and most creative science is done when scientists working in vastly different topics are talking and interacting with each other.
